## Deliverables

* Implement an app similar to the `notes` app, but with data of your choosing.
* Submit a file `models.txt` that describes (to other developers) what data you are storing in the database.
* The app needs to support authentication and expose a RESTful API to the data.

## Additional Deliverables

(In arbitrary order.)

* Add filters and search capabilities to your REST API.
* Add ability to upload attachments to your records; e.g. images, etc.
* Add ability to change an existing record, not just GET and POST.
* Add a Django front end to the data.
* Brainstorm a list of 10 additional features users would find useful.
* Implement the brainstormed list.
